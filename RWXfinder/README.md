# RWXfinder
Windows-specific tool written in C which uses Windows API functions to traverse through directories and look for DLL files with an RWX section in memory.

I came up with this idea after reading this blog: https://www.securityjoes.com/post/process-mockingjay-echoing-rwx-in-userland-to-achieve-code-execution
